Bug reports, feature requests or code contributions are always very welcome.
To make things easier, here are a few tips:

Reporting bugs, requesting features
-----------------------------------

*   Best way to report bugs and request new features is to use GitHub
    [issues](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-bootstrap/issues), but you can
    contact me also any other way.

Code contribution
-----------------

*   Building and installing Magnum is described in the [documentation](http://mosra.cz/blog/magnum-doc/building.html).
*   Follow the project coding guidelines. In short -- try to match style of the
    surrounding code and avoid any trailing whitespace. When in doubt, consult
    coding guidelines, which are available also [online](http://mosra.cz/blog/magnum-doc/coding-style.html).
*   Best way to contribute is by using GitHub [pull requests](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-bootstrap/pulls)
    -- fork the repository and make pull request from feature branch. You can
    also send patches via e-mail or contact me any other way.
*   While Magnum itself is released under MIT/Expat license (see [COPYING](COPYING)
    file for details), the bootstrap projects are released to public domain.
    To keep them as small and terse as possible no licensing information is put
    anywhere, allowing the users to freely use any license without dealing with
    relicensing issues.
